# Questions

Our [GitHub Discussions Board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/discussions) is a place to ask questions, share knowledge, and interact with others. It is a place to have conversations about coding and ask for further help.

## Why do we use the GitHub Discussions Board?

The ability to ask questions as a developer is crucial for effective problem solving, continuous learning, collaboration, and ensuring the success of projects. It is a fundamental skill that needs to be practiced and developed. And it is also necessary to learn to be able to speak about code and technical concepts in a way that is clear and concise.
